# PeripheralEdemaMeasurementHelper
This is an Android application which outputs edema dent duration time and edema stage given patient's skin dent video as the input, providing patients with a cost-effective and user-friendly way to do the edema measurement. In this application, dent duration (the time that dent remains on humanâ€™s skin) is the parameter used to measure edema.
